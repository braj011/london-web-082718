# React router

npm intsall --save react-router-dom

## BrowserRouter
Used in top level of the app, listenes to all the changes happening in the window, when the route changes and making that info accessible to everything else.

## Link
Changes the url we see in the browser, needs 'to' prop

## Route
Conditionally render components based on routes. Takes component or render prop

## Switch
Conditionally renders components based on url matches, removes the need to use exact path. Order of Routes matters.
